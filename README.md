# bunny-breeding
I built this app for my sister, who went through one too many bunny maintenance records. Written in python with some AI Magic, it tracks pairings, births, and lineages in one place. Now her rabbits get proper lineage charts, due dates, and baby logs no more messy notebooks. I hope it also helps other rabbit enthusiasts keep their herds in line.
