# Bunny-Breeding

A Python application for managing a bunny herd under the **GNU GPL v2.0** license. It streamlines tasks such as:
- Maintaining bunny profiles (name, gender, color, type, pedigree, DOB, and images).
- Recording breeding information with due dates, missed-litter options, and litter tracking.
- Registering new baby bunnies and completing their details later.
- Displaying a lineage graph for visualizing each bunnyâ€™s family tree.
- Listing unbred bunnies and identifying which does are due.
